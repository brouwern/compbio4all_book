After accounting for pairing success differences based on habitat quality (i.e. 0·85−0·97; Probst 1986; Rockwell 2013), the number of male fledglings produced per male was 1·52 and 1·74 in low/moderate suitability and high suitability habitat, respectively (see Fig. S6). We used an estimated hatch‐year survivorship of 0·415 (see Appendix S5 and Table S2).
