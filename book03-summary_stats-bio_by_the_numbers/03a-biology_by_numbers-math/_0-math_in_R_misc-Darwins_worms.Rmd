"Hensen...calculates, from the number which he found in a measured space, that there must exist 133,000 living worms in a hectare of land, or 53,767 in an acre.  This latter number of worms would weight 356 pounds, taking Hensen's standard of the weight of a single worm, namel one gram."

"...Hensen states that he found in a garden sixty-four open burrows in a space of 14.5 square feet, that is, nine in 2 square feet."

n.burrows <- 64

area <- 14.5

n.burrows/area

n.burrows/area*2

round(n.burrows/area*2)
